FOR FULL RECIPE CALC:

1. Input the wanted output (could be multiple maybe?)
2. Show all recipes for that resource (if only one only show none dialogue)
4. If user selects none, use that resource as a raw resource
3. If recipe has side product, add to excess list (dict of every resource and how many excess we have of each)
4. Go to step 2 for each input in the selected recipe

Things to do:
- Add multi-input support.
- Fill in json file.
