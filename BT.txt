2xBT per 24hrs:
100 StCom p.d.
60 AMat3 p.d.
120 AMat4 p.d.
70 AMat5 p.d.

Equals:
-4.2 StCom/hr
-2.5 AMat3/hr
-5 AMat4/hr
-2.92 AMat5/hr

For 3 AMat5/hr (1/6th of a factory cap):
-9 StCom/hr
-735 Coke/hr
-30 AMat1/hr
-30 AMat2/hr

For 13.2 StCom/hr (1/10th(ish) of a factory cap):
-40 PCon/hr
-1650 Coke/hr
-396L EOil/hr
-440L Water/hr

(Since the above 2 only use about 1/4th of factory cap, we can just use one engineering station building)

For 30 AMat1/hr (half a factory capacity):
-450 Scroop/hr
-2250 Coke/hr

For 30 AMat2/hr (half a factory capacity):
-450 Scroop/hr
-1500L Petrol/hr (extra 1500 if we want extra room to breathe)

For 405 EOil/hr (1/4th factory cap):
-135L HOil/hr
-270 Sulfur/hr

For 5 AMat4/hr (1/6th factory cap):
-330L HOil/hr
-5 PCon/hr

For 2.5 AMat3/hr (1/12th factory cap):
-50 Sulfur/hr
-7.5 CMat/hr

For 45 PCon/hr (1/4th factory cap):
-90L HOil/hr
-825 Comp/hr
-45 CMat/hr

(Since above 2 only use about 1/2 of a factory, it is advised to just use one factory for both. Additionally, a recycler factory can be made to lighten this factories PCon load. If more PCons are needed, then it may be wise to build a secong metalworks factory I think? Idk.a)

For 54 CMat/hr (Rounded up to be 1/8th of a factory):
-270 Scroop/hr
-450L Petrol/hr

For 4635 Coke/hr (Method 1):
5150 Coal/hr

For 4635 Coke/hr and 421 Sulfur/hr (Method 2):
-5619 Coal/hr

(Method 2 ensures we will never need to get sulfur from a field, however it is fairly inefficient. Method 1 requires 123,600 (25 Flatbeds) Coal per day, which is already a lot. Method 2 requires 134,856 (27 Flatbeds) Coal per day, which is 2 more flatbeds worth, and may be a bitch to get, however it saves getting 7,680 (1.5 flatbeds) worth of sulfur, and as such may be easier to organise.)

Final Result (no excess, not including oil processing):
440L Water/hr (automated)
1,170 Scroop/hr
1,950L Petrol/hr (automated)
555L HOil/hr (automated)
825 Comp/hr
5619 Coal/hr
